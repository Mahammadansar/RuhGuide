PWA Icons Required:
===================

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can:
- Use an online PWA icon generator
- Create custom Islamic-themed icons
- Use a tool like: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

Suggested design: A simple Islamic symbol or Quran-related icon with a green color scheme to match the app theme.

Once created, place both files in the /public folder.
